### Consumer Review Data

Due to privacy issues with merchants, we have deleted fraudulent data containing their names. Although the amount of data is less than the original dataset, it is still available.

## We have transferred the data to a new storage repository, which can be found at https://github.com/laishanyan/Consumer-fraud-detection-dataset.

## We will continue to update the data to provide more samples to advance the area.
